## MEDSLIK-II NECCTON

MEDSLIK-II NECCTON is a customised version of the open-source MEDSLIK-II oil spill model documented [`MEDSLIK_II`](https://www.medslik-ii.org/). The code is based on Version 1.01 of the historical code, which works for the Mediterranean Sea.
MEDSLIK-II simulates oil spill trajectory and fate due to three main processes known collectively as weathering: viscousâ€“gravity spreading, evaporation, and natural dispersion. The formation of water- in-oil emulsion is also considered. 
If oil arrives on the coast, the model simulates the adsorption of oil droplets into the coastal environment while considering the probability that oil may be washed back into the water.


### Installation

The currently supported architectures is Linux. The details of installation can be found in the Quick-Start Guide and Manual published at [`MEDSLIK_II`](https://www.medslik-ii.org/).
